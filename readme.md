## 📦 Features

- 🔐 User registration and login
- 🛍️ Product listing with categories
- 🛒 Add to cart, apply coupons, checkout
- 🚚 Estimated delivery and order confirmation
- 🌐 Fully containerized frontend and backend
- 🗄️ Backend with SQLite for lightweight DB
- 🚀 CI/CD pipeline with GitHub → CodePipeline → ECS
- ☁️ Deployed using AWS CloudFormation & ECS Fargate
- 🔒 Hosted in private subnets with NAT Gateway and WAF protection

  Application Load Balancer
        │
        ▼
ECS Fargate (Frontend + Backend Containers)
        │
        ▼
Private Subnets → NAT Gateway → Internet

    CloudWatch Logs + CI/CD via CodePipeline


- **VPC** with public/private subnets across 2 AZs
- **ALB** routes frontend (`/`) and backend (`/api`)
- **NAT Gateway** for secure internet access from private subnets
- **CloudWatch** & **CloudTrail** for monitoring/logging
- **IAM** roles for ECS, ECR, CodeBuild, and Secrets Manager

## 🧪 Getting Started (Local)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aishu0110/Capstone-final.git
   cd Capstone-final
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

3. **Backend Setup:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   node server.js
   ```

---

## ☁️ Deployment (AWS)

1. Dockerize frontend and backend
2. Push images to ECR:
   ```bash
   docker build -t macdash-frontend ./frontend
   docker tag macdash-frontend:latest <your-ecr-uri>/macdash-frontend:latest
   docker push <your-ecr-uri>/macdash-frontend:latest
   ```

3. Use CloudFormation to deploy:
   - VPC, Subnets, NAT
   - ALB, ECS Cluster, Task Definitions
   - CI/CD pipeline

4. CodePipeline picks up GitHub changes and auto-deploys to ECS.

---

## 🔐 Security Highlights

- Backend & database hosted in private subnets
- WAF in front of ALB with managed rule sets
- IAM roles scoped to least privilege
- Sensitive credentials managed via AWS Secrets Manager
